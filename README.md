# OneShot
Terraform modules that will give you a IaaS Base infrastructure to get started on the cloud of your choice.  As I get time, I will expand this to additional cloud providers.  Each Module/Live will have its own README.md to look at for reference.

## Note about Passwords/Tokens/Authorization ##
There is mention of "secrets.tfvars" in the documentation.  This is meant to contain properties/data that should not get sent to source control (for obvious reasons).
